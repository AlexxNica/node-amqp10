node-amqp-1-0
=============

AMQP 1.0-compliant Node.js client.  Since AMQP 1.0 is such a large departure from 0.9.1, 
I've started a new project rather than fork from node-amqp or amqp.node.  Both node-amqp and amqp.node are
great 0.9.1 clients and I recommend them, but neither is pursuing a 1.0 implementation.  If I can find an
easy way to integrate this code back into them, I'll definitely be submitting a PR.

## Caveats ##

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!  I'm just starting on this work - please ignore this repo for now.  Unless you want to help,
in which case PR's are welcome :)

## License ##

MIT License.  If you need a more permissive license, or you want to try your hand at integrating this code into
node-amqp or amqp.node and need to match their license, let me know (i.e. open an issue).
