/**
 * <h2>disposition performative</h2>
 * <i>inform remote peer of delivery state changes</i>
 * 
 *           The disposition frame is used to inform the remote peer of local changes in the state of
 *           deliveries. The disposition frame may reference deliveries from many different links
 *           associated with a session, although all links MUST have the directionality indicated by
 *           the specified .
 *         
 * 
 *           Note that it is possible for a disposition sent from sender to receiver to refer to a
 *           delivery which has not yet completed (i.e. a delivery which is spread over multiple
 *           frames and not all frames have yet been sent). The use of such interleaving is
 *           discouraged in favor of carrying the modified state on the next 
 *           performative for the delivery.
 *

 * 
 *           The disposition performative may refer to deliveries on links that are no longer attached.
 *           As long as the links have not been closed or detached with an error then the deliveries
 *           are still "live" and the updated state MUST be applied.
